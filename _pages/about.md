I'm tawsif (otherwise known as Ammar), I used to be an artificial intelligence lead at Harvard GAMI, where I worked for almost two years before leaving to become a Computational Neuroscience researcher at Donders Institute through Genzel lab. I was there for two years and then pivoted to open-source contributions and leading my own projects for research papers. 

Currently, I work and collab with LAION and Israeli universities at a regular interval and have high-frequency and impactful projects with them. I also work independently and lead my own team and have sponsors, donations and EU grants supporting me. Most of these donations are provided through dark channels (meaning no questions asked and I only need to publish the work). 

In this blog, I write about Software Engineering, research software engineering and DevOps. I have separate research blog and personal website. https://sleeping4cat.github.io/sleepingcat/ and
